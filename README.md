# Hey, I am Lincoln
So, welcome to my personal page. If you have no idea how you got here, it is ok, no one really knows. This is just my personal page and playground. I pretty much have my contact information and a few status updated regularly. Feel free to send a message ::)

# About me
Soo, basically, I was born in 1988, so I am from the 80's, don't ever think about taking this from me, lol. My dream job was to be a fireman, but somehow I got into Computer Science and now I am a Data Engineer, what I love. I don't know how to define myself without talking about work, maybe a friend could do a better job on this. 

I love buying stuff and giving gifts. I love hugs and anime, I love eating and cuddling. I am merried and have two dogs and I love small computers, like the [intel nuc ones](https://www.intel.com.br/content/www/br/pt/products/details/nuc.html) , sad they are killing it.

I struggle with weight since I was little so I have some hardships with my body, don't be mean, you can mock me about other stuff, it is ok.

Oh, also, I am brazilian
